When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you will be sharing the repository with other people.
    When you will be working on the repository from different computers.

automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For control over exactly what you pull. Less chance of corrupting your
    local repository with something unwanted.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you

    A clone will copy a repository on GitHub to your local machine.
    A branch is a new copy of the repository kept internal to the repository.
